# UkiyoeFusion Status Update

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING (Fallback Mode)

### What's Working Now

- ✅ **Backend API**: Running on http://localhost:5001
- ✅ **Frontend UI**: Running on http://localhost:3001
- ✅ **Basic Ukiyo-e Transformation**: Full functionality with your custom parameters
- ✅ **Your Custom Settings**:
  - Default prompt: "ukiyo-e woodblock print, Edo period, mountain landscape, bold outlines, flat colors, traditional Japanese art, masterpiece"
  - Default negative prompt: "modern, contemporary, 3D, photorealistic, blurry, low quality"
  - Classic Ukiyo-e style only (as requested)
  - Fixed 512x512 dimensions
  - Strength: 0.75, Guidance: 8.5, Steps: 25

### Quick Start

```bash
# Use the fallback version (works immediately)
./run_fallback.sh
```

### What's Not Available Yet

- ⏳ **ControlNet Integration**: Still installing dependencies
- ⏳ **Structural Guidance**: Edge, depth, and pose preservation

### Issue Resolution

The "Failed to load application data" error was caused by:

1. **Missing ControlNet dependencies** - The full installation was still in progress
2. **API endpoint mismatch** - Frontend couldn't connect to backend during installation
3. **CORS configuration** - Needed to allow the new port

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Created Fallback Version** (`app_fallback.py`)

   - All core functionality without ControlNet dependencies
   - Immediate startup without waiting for large package downloads

2. **Fixed API Configuration**

   - Updated CORS settings for multiple ports
   - Fixed API base URL in frontend
   - Added error handling for missing ControlNet features

3. **Improved Startup Scripts**
   - `./run_fallback.sh` - Quick start without ControlNet
   - `./run.sh` - Full version (use after installation completes)

### Next Steps

1. **Continue Full Installation** (Optional)
   ```bash
   # Let the original installation finish in background
   ./run.sh
   ```
2. **Use Current Working Version**

   ```bash
   # Start with working fallback version
   ./run_fallback.sh
   ```

3. **When ControlNet is Ready**
   - Replace `app_fallback.py` usage with `app.py`
   - ControlNet features will automatically become available

### Testing Your Application

1. **Open**: http://localhost:3001
2. **Upload an image** or use camera capture
3. **Add optional prompt** (will be appended to default)
4. **Transform** to see Ukiyo-e style applied
5. **Download** the result

### Current Capabilities

- ✅ File upload and camera capture
- ✅ Custom Ukiyo-e style transformation
- ✅ Prompt enhancement (your text + default prompt)
- ✅ Advanced parameter controls
- ✅ Real-time image processing
- ✅ Download functionality

The application is fully functional for Ukiyo-e style transformation. ControlNet features will be available once the installation completes.
